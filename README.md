# Predicting-Insurance-Claim-Amount-with-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict insurance claim amounts. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the claim amount based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, region, diabetic condition, blood pressure, and number of children.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project contains information about insurance policyholders, including their demographic and health-related attributes, as well as the corresponding insurance claim amounts. It is a structured dataset with both numerical and categorical variables.

**Project Workflow**
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, and scaling numerical features using the standard scaler.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the relationships between variables and the target variable (claim amount). Visualizations and statistical analysis help uncover patterns and understand the data better.

- Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated on the dataset. Regression models such as Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost are used to predict the insurance claim amount. The models' performance metrics, including mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared, are used to assess their effectiveness.

- Model Evaluation: The models' performance is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics. The chosen model is further fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize its performance.

- Interpretation: The final model's feature importance is analyzed to understand the significant predictors affecting the insurance claim amount. This provides insights into which variables have the most substantial impact on the predictions.

- Deep Learning Approach
Additionally, a deep learning approach is explored using a neural network to predict insurance claim amounts. A sequential model with multiple layers, including dense layers, is constructed. The model is trained and evaluated on the dataset, and its performance is compared with the other machine learning models.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict insurance claim amounts. By analyzing various factors and training predictive models, we can estimate the claim amount accurately. The chosen model, along with its evaluation metrics and feature importance, provides valuable insights for insurance companies in determining appropriate claim amounts.
